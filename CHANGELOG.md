# Change Log

This is a changelog file for the Starcoin IDE.

## v0.1.0 - Fresh Start

This update sets the new version of Starcoin IDE as a replacement to the previous one.

- Binary that is now used as a backend is `move` by Starcoin team. It gets automatically pulled on 
extension start. And auto updates. Most of the commands of the binary are integrated into this extension.
- Syntax highlighting is provided by the `move-syntax` extension and is added as a dependency.
